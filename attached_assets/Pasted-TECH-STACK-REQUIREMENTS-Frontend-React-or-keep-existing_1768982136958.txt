TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS
	∙	Frontend: React (or keep existing stack from Srsly)
	∙	State Management: Keep Srsly’s existing state management
	∙	Storage: LocalStorage initially (should be easy to migrate to PostgreSQL/SQLite later)
	∙	Styling: Tailwind CSS or existing Srsly styles
	∙	Algorithm: SM-2 spaced repetition (should already be in Srsly)
CORE FEATURES TO KEEP FROM SRSLY
	∙	SM-2 algorithm implementation
	∙	Card review interface with quality ratings (Again/Hard/Good/Easy)
	∙	Daily review queue
	∙	Basic statistics
CUSTOM FEATURES TO ADD
	1.	Card Structure for Armenian
Each flashcard should have these fields:
	∙	Front: Armenian word (in Armenian script)
	∙	Back: Russian translation
	∙	Example Sentence: Armenian sentence using the word (optional field)
	∙	Association: Mnemonic/association note in Russian (optional field)
	∙	Difficulty Star: Visual indicator if word is marked as difficult
Input requirements:
	∙	Support for Armenian keyboard input (Eastern Armenian)
	∙	All fields should support Unicode Armenian characters (Ա-Ֆ, ա-ֆ)
	2.	Batch Import Feature
	∙	Import 50 cards at once from CSV or JSON
	∙	CSV format: armenian,russian,sentence,association
	∙	Bulk add to deck with single click
	3.	Custom Review Settings
	∙	Allow manual override of SM-2 intervals
	∙	Preset: “Weekend learner mode”
	∙	Higher review load on weekends (Sat-Sun)
	∙	Lighter review load on weekdays (Mon-Fri)
	∙	Setting to prioritize starred/difficult cards
	4.	Armenian-Specific UI Elements
	∙	Display Armenian text in larger, readable font (suggest: Noto Serif Armenian or similar)
	∙	Keyboard shortcuts:
	∙	Space: flip card
	∙	1-4: rate card (Again/Hard/Good/Easy)
	∙	S: star/unstar current card
	∙	RTL-aware layout (Armenian is LTR but good to have flexibility)
	5.	Progress Tracking
	∙	Cards learned this week (out of 50 target)
	∙	Retention rate graph
	∙	“Difficult words” list (starred cards)
	∙	Export review history to CSV
	6.	Deck Organization
	∙	Create weekly decks: “Week 1”, “Week 2”, etc.
	∙	Tag system for random/unsystematic vocabulary
	∙	Quick filter: “Due today”, “New”, “Difficult”
NICE-TO-HAVE FEATURES
	∙	Dark mode toggle
	∙	Audio recording field (for pronunciation practice)
	∙	Example sentence translation on hover
	∙	Export deck to Anki format for backup
	∙	PWA support for mobile use
DATA PERSISTENCE
	∙	Start with LocalStorage
	∙	Structure data so migration to backend DB is straightforward
	∙	Export/import functionality to prevent data loss
DEPLOYMENT
	∙	Should run on Replit
	∙	Easy to deploy to personal server later (Docker-ready would be ideal)
UI/UX PREFERENCES
	∙	Clean, minimal interface
	∙	No unnecessary animations (keep it fast)
	∙	Mobile-responsive (but desktop is primary use case)
	∙	Keyboard-first navigation
INITIAL SETUP
	1.	Fork Srsly repository
	2.	Set up development environment
	3.	Create sample deck with 5 Armenian cards for testing
	4.	Implement core customizations first (card structure, Armenian input)
	5.	Add batch import
	6.	Add custom features
TESTING DATA
Include sample Armenian vocabulary for testing:
գիրք,книга,Իմ գիրքը սեղանի վրա է։,гирька упала на книгу
սուրճ,кофе,Ես սուրճ եմ խմում առավոտյան։,
ջուր,вода,Խնդրում եմ ինձ ջուր տվեք։,
SUCCESS CRITERIA
	∙	Can add 50 Armenian cards quickly (under 5 minutes)
	∙	SM-2 algorithm schedules reviews correctly
	∙	Cards display Armenian script clearly
	∙	Can complete daily reviews in 10-15 minutes
	∙	Data persists across browser sessions
	∙	Can export progress to CSV
QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE DURING DEVELOPMENT
	∙	If Srsly repo is not suitable, suggest alternative open-source SRS to fork
	∙	Recommend best Armenian web font for readability
	∙	Suggest optimal SM-2 parameter tweaks for 50 words/week intake
Please fork Srsly, implement these customizations, and create a working prototype I can test immediately.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
